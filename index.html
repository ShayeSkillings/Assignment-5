            In this 1976 novel, the narrator, Norman Maclean, reflects on his own childhood and early adulthood experiences describing what it was like to grow 
            up in Missoula, Montana. The Maclean family consists of Norman, his father Reverend Maclean, and his brother Paul. Normans father was a Scottish 
            Presbyterian minister who valued two things: God and fly-fishing.

            Throughout their childhood, Normans and Paul spent much of their time in church. When they weren't attending church or studying the Bible, they
            found sanctuary were on the river. Thier father taught him and Paul the art of fly fishing, which they all bonded over throughout their lives.

            Norman is portrayed as the responsible and introspective brother, while Paul is more wild and adventurous. From a young age, he is known to be incredibly 
            stubborn, and begins to engage in gambling, drinking, and fighing as he grows older. Norman spends his teenage summers working for the United States Forest 
            Service, while Paul works as a lifeguard, giving him time to fish in the evenings. Out of the two, Paul becomes an expert fisherman, and his main goal is to 
            not let work get in the way of his fishing. Norman marries his wife Jessie, and lives with his wife’s family in the tiny town of Wolf Creek, Montana. Paul 
            later becomes a newspaper reporter in Helena, Montana.

            During the summer of 1937, Norman and his parents watch as Paul’s life spirals out of control: he is arrested for public drunkenness and fighting, 
            and they suspect he has large gambling debts that he cannot pay. Norman tries to intervene by taking going to Helena to go fishing with Paul. Normans wife Jessie 
            convinces Norman to take her problematic, alcoholic brother Neal fishing with them. The fishing trip is disastrous, as Neal steals all of the groups alcohol and 
            gets drunk, and runs off to mess around with a prostitute on a sandbar, and ends up getting a horrific sunburn. Jessie is not pleased with Paul for not keeping a
            close eye on her brother Neal. Jessie and Norman work their problems out, and Norman goes back to Helena to fish with Paul. Norman admires Paul's extensive time 
            spent on the river and his shadow casting technique. Norman stays with Paul for the night, but Paul leaves town. In the middle of the night, Norman gets a call
            to come down to the jail. Paul had gotten into a fight with a man who had insulted the girl he was with, a part-Native American woman. Norman drives them home, 
            and then drives back to Wolf Creek himself, trying to figure out how he might be able to help Paul.

            Later, Paul and Norman visit their parents’ home and invite their father to fish with them. Their parents are happy to see them, but are upset when Paul sneaks 
            away after dinner to go to the bars. However, he is ready the next morning to go fishing. The three of them fish a number of holes together. At the start, Norman 
            is more successful than his brother, and this makes him feel proud, but Paul's skills soon show as he becomes more successful. After a while, Norman decides he is 
            finished, and sits by his father, who’s reading the Bible. They both watch and admire as Paul trys to reach his limit when catching a fish.

            Long after the event, Norman notes that he often thinks about this fishing trip, since it was the last time he would fish with Paul. Soon after, Paul was beaten to 
            death and left outside an alley. Norman and his father ponder time and time again if there was anything they could have done, but never reach an answer. All they can 
            truly understand is that Paul was an incredible fisherman and artist. As an old man, Norman continues to fly-fish, reveling in the beauty and art of the sport, but 
            he continues to be haunted by his past.
